     If the user wants their bonus to not include dollar chips (i.e. incremented in 5s) then we
     remove the amounts that don't end in five or zero by dividing and then multiplying by five,
     this effectively rounds all numbers down to the nearest multiple of five.
     
     The advantage of this rounding down method: if the user input a floor and/or ceiling containing
     units of a dollar (e.g. "103") the following method will round down the randomly generated 
     amount. e.g. if the user wants a number between "0" and "104" but says they want the question 
     to not include dollar chips, a random generation of "104" will automatically be rounded down 
     to 100. Thus we can never exceed our ceiling but don't need a special case of rounding for 
     when the floor or ceiling amounts are not devisible by 5.
